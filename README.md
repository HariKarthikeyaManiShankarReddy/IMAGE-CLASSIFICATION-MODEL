DESCRIPTION:

Convolutional Neural Network is a specialized neural network used primarily for image recognition and computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection and facial recognition. It automatically 

learns spatial hierarchies of features of images.

CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) Architecture consists of several layers:

1.Input Layer: It takes image as input, here images are represented as 3D matrices.

2.Convolutional Layer: This layer applies kernel/filter to the images to extract features like edges,corners etc..

3.Activation Layer: (ReLU) It adds non linearity to the images and makes the model to learn complex patterns (ReLU-Rectified Linear Unit)

4.Pooling layer: In this layer model reduces the spatial size of the feature maps. There are two types of pooling techniques Max Pooling and Average Pooling techniques
this layer helps in reducing overfitting and computation load on the model.

5.Flatten Layer: This layer converts 2D feature maps into 1D feature map. So that it can be an input to a fully connected input layer

6.Fully Connected (Dense Layer): Each neuron is connected to all other neurons of the previous layer.

Applications of CNN:

1. Object Detection.

2. Image Classification.

3. Medical Image Analysis.

4. Self Driving Cars.

The library used to bulid Convolutional Neural Network is "TensorFlow". This library is an open source machine learning frame work. It is one of the widely used tools in deep learning and machine learning.

It provides both low-level API for custom model building and high-level API for easier and faster model deployment.
